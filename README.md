This repository is mainly used to achieve instance segmentation of coal dust particles and perform relevant particle size distribution statistics.


## Installation

First install Detectron2 following the official guide: [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

*Please use Detectron2 with commit id [9eb4831](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/commit/9eb4831f742ae6a13b8edb61d07b619392fb6543) if you have any issues related to Detectron2.*

Then build AdelaiDet with:

```
git clone https://github.com/aim-uofa/AdelaiDet.git
cd AdelaiDet
python setup.py build develop
```

If you are using docker, a pre-built image can be pulled with:

```
docker pull tianzhi0549/adet:latest
```

Some projects may require special setup, please follow their own `README.md` in [configs](configs).

## Quick Start

### Inference with Pre-trained Models

1. Pick a model and its config file, for example, `fcos_R_50_1x.yaml`.
2. Download the model `wget https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/glqFc13cCoEyHYy/download -O fcos_R_50_1x.pth`
3. Run the demo with
```
python demo/demo.py \
    --config-file configs/FCOS-Detection/R_50_1x.yaml \
    --input input1.jpg input2.jpg \
    --opts MODEL.WEIGHTS fcos_R_50_1x.pth
```

### Train Your Own Models

To train a model with "train_net.py", first
setup the corresponding datasets following
[datasets/README.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/datasets/README.md),
then run:

```
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 python tools/train_net.py \
    --config-file configs/FCOS-Detection/R_50_1x.yaml \
    --num-gpus 8 \
    OUTPUT_DIR training_dir/fcos_R_50_1x
```
To evaluate the model after training, run:

```
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 python tools/train_net.py \
    --config-file configs/FCOS-Detection/R_50_1x.yaml \
    --eval-only \
    --num-gpus 8 \
    OUTPUT_DIR training_dir/fcos_R_50_1x \
    MODEL.WEIGHTS training_dir/fcos_R_50_1x/model_final.pth
```
Note that:
- The configs are made for 8-GPU training. To train on another number of GPUs, change the `--num-gpus`.
- If you want to measure the inference time, please change `--num-gpus` to 1.
- We set `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` by default, which achieves the best speed on our machines, please change it as needed.
- This quick start is made for FCOS. If you are using other projects, please check the projects' own `README.md` in [configs](configs).
